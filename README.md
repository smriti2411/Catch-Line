# Catch-Line
Catch Line is a social networking platform. We have built this with the aim of connecting book readers world wide.

You might wonder the need for another platform when we already have dozens out in the market competing for a name. Well, to answer that, we agree there are plenty of social media platforms but what makes Catch Line different is the market it targets. We want to bring people closer over their common likeliness of book reading and sharing two worlds in common; fictional and real.

Often, we read books and articles and it only gets better when we thoroughly indulge into discussions. But it is observed that a gap exists between people who equally understand the depths and gravity of a particular book. Hence, to bridge those gaps and to take book reading experience to another level we bring to you Catch Line; a web app that not only helps in finding your book soulmate but also recommends books.

Through our book recommendation and profile matching algorithm you get the best of both worlds.
